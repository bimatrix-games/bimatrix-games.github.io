{"name":"Bimatrix games","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Bimatrix-Games\r\n\r\nBimatrix games is library of games useful for testing game theoretic algorithms.\r\nThe library was built as an extension to the currently existing GAMUT library of\r\ngames due to its lack of games which were hard to solve for approximate algorithms.\r\nWith that in mind, we built this library as a test suite for approximation\r\nalgorithms. There are currently two projects hosted :\r\n\r\n- Algorithms <http://bimatrix-games.github.io/eps-nash-algos> : This contains\r\n  implementations of various algorithms for the approximation of Nash equibrium.\r\n  The algorithms implemented consist of DMP, BBM1, BBM2, TS and KS.\r\n- Game Library <http://bimatrix-games.github.io/bimatrix-generators> : This\r\n  contains the implementations of several classes of games which were introduced\r\n  to study their properties with regards to approximation.","google":"UA-59447094-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
